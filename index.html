							<h2>Splootie on Christmas Eve</h2>

							<h2>Splootie, Gift & The Letter</h2>
							<p>The door had burst open, and to his surprise, Hagrid, Santa and Hegwig were in his living room parading a sealed letter for Priya. Hagrid told Splootie that he was the only one who could get this important letter to Priya (which was great, as Splootie wanted to go to see Priya, so it was a win-win). Santa was just being lazy this Christmas and wanted give Priya her present via Splootie. So Splootie quickly got up and got his stuff packed, carrying the essential items, such as my homeless stick, the letter and bag, and set off to see Priya for Christmas!</p>

Splootie explained what was going on, and the crew couldn't understand why Hagrid and Santa were kicking it together  in this weird cross-over, but Splootie explained there was time to explain, and the guys said they'd follow him.</p>

Needless to say, the DJ's put the tunes on, and Splootie and the gang got it in. No-one even knew there was another Giraffe in the club, but as you can see boy was throwing shapes</p>
